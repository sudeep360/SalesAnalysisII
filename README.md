# SalesAnalysisII
I've used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data.
The data contains thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

Check on the Sales_Analysis to see the cleaned, and analyzed result that also shares some hypothesis to maxamize sales.
